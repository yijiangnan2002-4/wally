 * This section introduces the airo_cqueue APIs including supported features, software architecture, and details on how to use airo_cqueue structures and functions.
 * Airo_cqueue is a lightweight fixed size queue service. It can be used to send messages between tasks, and between interrupts and tasks.
 * It is used as a thread-safe First In First Out (FIFO) buffer with new data being sent to the back of the queue.
 * Suggest Airo_cqueue is used only when the system doesn't have operation system, such as FreeRTOS, because of the limited function.
 *
 * @section Airo_cqueue_Usage_Chapter How to use airo_cqueue
 *  Use airo_cqueue to create a queue. Then, send to and receive from the queue. For example:
 *  - \b Step 1. Include airo_cqueue module.mk in your project makefile.
 *  @code
 *  //file:dsp\project\ab1558_evk\templates\dsp1_create_message_queue\XT-XCC\Makefile
 *   ################################################################################
 *   # Include Module Configuration
 *   ################################################################################
 *   include $(ROOTDIR)/kernel/service/airo_cqueue/module.mk
 *  @endcode
 *  - \b Step 2. Define the queue message structure. Queue item counts as your request, and statically allocates memory for the queue.
 *       Note: The buffer must be allocated at the word aligned address, and must also include the queue ctrl block size size(airo_cqueue_t).
 *  @code
 *  //file:dsp\project\ab1558_evk\templates\dsp1_create_message_queue\inc\message_queue_configure.h
 *  typedef struct {
 *      message_event_id_t event_id;
 *  } message_queue_t;
 *  //file:dsp\project\ab1558_evk\templates\dsp1_create_message_queue\src\main.c
 *  #define MESSAGE_QUEUE_ITEMS 16
 *  void *p_message_queue = NULL;
 *  __attribute__((__aligned__(4))) char queue_buffer[sizeof(airo_cqueue_t) + MESSAGE_QUEUE_ITEMS * sizeof(message_queue_t)];
 *  @endcode
 *  - \b Step 3. Call airo_cqueue_create() to create a queue.
 *  @code
 *  //file:dsp\project\ab1558_evk\templates\dsp1_create_message_queue\src\main.c
 *  p_message_queue = airo_cqueue_create(MESSAGE_QUEUE_ITEMS, sizeof(message_queue_t), (void *)queue_buffer);
 *  assert(p_message_queue);
 *  @endcode
 *  - \b Step 4. Package a message and call airo_cqueue_send() to send the messgae to the queue.
 *  @code
 *  //file:dsp\kernel\service\pre_libloader\dsp1\dsp1_pic_demo_portable\dsp1_pisplit_demo_library_portable.c
 *  bool ret = false;
 *  message_queue_t dsp1_lib_demo_message;
 *  dsp1_lib_demo_message.event_id = MESSAGE_DSP1_PISPLIT_LIBRARY_DEMO_LOADING_DONE;
 *  ret = airo_cqueue_send(p_message_queue, (void *)&dsp1_lib_demo_message);
 *  assert(ret);
 *  @endcode
 *  - \b Step 5. Call airo_cqueue_receive() to receive a message from the queue.
 *  @code
 *  //file:dsp\project\ab1558_evk\templates\dsp1_create_message_queue\src\main.c
 *  //Main loop to handle message
 *  while (airo_cqueue_message_waiting(p_message_queue)) {
 *      //Receive a message from preloader queue
 *      ret = airo_cqueue_receive(p_message_queue, (void *)&message);
 *      if (ret) {
 *          //......
 *      }
 *  }
 *  @endcode

If you want to assign some dynamic memory as PIC memory pools for PIC library.

If user have no any change, please clone this structure to your project.
On this example, Airoha reference project just use the dynamic pools for the feature of DSP1 PIC solution.
    On the feature of DSP0 will help DSP1 to load its PIC library. So the PIC memory pools of DSP1 I/DRAM will controlled by DSP1.
    Because of DSP1 be aware of the DSP1 I/DRAM unlti DSP1 booting up, so DSP0 should request the information from DSP1 via CCCI,
    so the memory pools of DSP1 will be dynamic register for DSP1.

    User must be pay attention to the parameter of preloader_pisplit_memory_type_t, this means the type of memory pool.
    When you load your PIC load, should choose which memory type.
    As the feature of DSP0 help DSP1 to load, will use the type of PRELOADER_EXT_IRAM and PRELOADER_EXT_DRAM.
 When DSP0 want to load DSP1 library or want to allocate extra memory from DSP1 I/DRAM, need the parameters of PRELOADER_EXT_IRAM and PRELOADER_EXT_DRAM.

 * |Terms                         |Details                                                                 |

 * |\b DWT                        | DWT is the Debug Watchpoint and Trace Unit of DSP. For more details. |
 *
 * @section HAL_DWT_Features_Chapter Supported features
 *
 * - \b Support \b allocate \b a \b DWT \b channel \b for \b watchpoints. \n
 *   Allocate a DWT channel by #hal_dwt_request_watchpoint() \n
 *   For address matching, the comparator can use a mask, so it can match a specific address and also support match a range of addresses. \n
 *   It will generate a DebugMonitor exception on a successful match. \n
 *   \n
 *
 * - \b Support \b enable \b and \b disable \b the \b DWT \b channel. \n
 *   Enable or disable the DWT channel by #hal_dwt_control_watchpoint() \n
 *   \n
 *
 * @section HAL_DWT_Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use this driver
 *  - step1: Masking DWT channel number that you want to use,You need to mask the line of funtion hal_dwt_request_watchpoint(channel1 or channel2) in port.c file
 *  - step2: call #hal_dwt_init() to init the DWT unit.
 *  - step3: call #hal_dwt_request_watchpoint() to allocate a DWT channel masked in step1 and start the watchpoints.
 *  - step4: call #hal_dwt_control_watchpoint() to enable or disable the DWT channel if needed.
 *  - sample code:
 *    @code
 *       int ret;
 *       uint32_t mask;
 *       static uint32_t check_addr = 0x0;
 *
 *       hal_dwt_init();
 *
 *       //allocate DWT channel 0 to monitor the address range [0, (2^3-1)].
 *       //the start_addr must be aligned with 2^3.
 *       //only write access(WDE_DATA_WO) to the specific address range [0, (2^3-1)] will generate a DebugMonitor exception.
 *       ret = hal_dwt_request_watchpoint(HAL_DWT_0, (uint32_t)&check_addr, 0x3, WDE_DATA_WO);
 *       if(0 != ret) {
 *             //error handle
 *       }
 *
 *      //#hal_dwt_control_watchpoint() can be used to enable or disable the monitor.
 *      hal_nvic_save_and_set_interrupt_mask(&mask);
 *      hal_dwt_control_watchpoint(HAL_DWT_0, HAL_DWT_DISABLE); //disable the monitor.
 *      check_addr = 0x1; //not update the value,the check_addr was the pass second parameter in the last hal_dwt_request_watchpoint called.
 *      hal_dwt_control_watchpoint(HAL_DWT_0, HAL_DWT_ENABLE); //re-start the monitor.
 *      hal_nvic_restore_interrupt_mask(mask);

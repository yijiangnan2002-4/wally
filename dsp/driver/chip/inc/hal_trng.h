 * |\b TRNG                |True Randam Number Generator. TRNG is a hardware generator to generate random data for applications. |

 * @section HAL_TRNG_Driver_Usage_Chapter  How to use this driver
 *
 * - Trigger TRNG to generate a random number. \n
 *  - Step1: Call hal_trng_init() to initialize the TRNG clock.
 *  - Step2: Call hal_trng_get_generated_random_number() to generate random number.
 *  - Step3: Call hal_trng_deinit() to de-initialize the TRNG.
 *  - Sample code:
 *  @code
 *       uint32_t random_number;
 *       int32_t  random_data;
 *
 *       //Initializes the TRNG source clock.
 *       if(HAL_TRNG_STATUS_OK != hal_trng_init()) {
 *             //error handle
 *       }
 *       //Gets the random number.
 *       if(HAL_TRNG_STATUS_OK != hal_trng_get_generated_random_number(&random_number)) {
 *             //error handle
 *       }
 *       // random_number is ready to use.
 *       hal_trng_deinit();   // Deinitializes the TRNG.
 *
 *       //If you care about the time of random data generation, you could use trng APIs to generate the seed and use rand() API to generate random data.
 *       srand(random_number);
 *       random_data = rand();

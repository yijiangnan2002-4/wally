 * @section HAL_Overview_2_Chapter    Overview of HAL drivers
 *
 * - \b Introduction \n
 *   Airoha SDK hardware abstraction layer (HAL) driver is embedded software ensuring maximized portability across IoT portfolio designed for Airoha IoT SDK development platform.\n
 *   The HAL driver interface is common for DSP0 and DSP1, because DSP0 and DSP1 with same type of processor and share same peripheral hardware.
 *   The HAL driver includes:\n
 *   - Drivers for the peripheral modules, such as UART and I2C;\n
 *   - Drivers for the system modules, such as CACHE, MPU and FLASH;\n
 *   - APIs of the modules.\n
 *
 *   The HAL driver has both standard and advanced features and is easy to use. It makes the upper hardware abstraction layer portable.\n
 *   The HAL layer provides a generic set of APIs to interact with the upper layers, such as application, middleware and the OS. The APIs are defined interfaces for Airoha IoT portfolio, so the upper layer written with the HAL API is portable across the Airoha IoT platforms.\n
 *   The HAL driver covers rich modules, including all peripheral modules, such as UART, I2C and SPI. It also includes number of system modules, such as CACHE, MPU, FLASH and DMA.\n
 *   The HAL complies with the general naming convention and common coding style. Each module of the HAL has its distinctive folder structure along with supporting examples.
 * - \b HAL \b driver \b architecture \n

 *       All HAL drivers are in driver/chip/mtxxxx/inc and driver/chip/mtxxxx/src,
 *       they are named as hal_{feature}.c or hal_{feature}_{sub_feature}.c,
 *       (e.g., hal_cache.c and hal_cache_internal.c)\n

 *       |function pointer names | hal_{feature}_{sub_feature}_t(), such as void (*#hal_nvic_isr_t)().\n
 *
 * - \b HAL \b configuration \n
 *  - \b hal_feature_config.h \n
 *      Every project should include hal_feature_config.h for HAL configuration.\n
 *      If certain HAL modules are not used, they can be removed from the feature options by undefining the macro, such as undefine the option of HAL_CACHE_MODULE_ENABLED.\n
 *      For customized parameter settings.\n
 * \n
 * \n
 * @section HAL_Overview_3_Chapter    HAL Driver Model
 * Some drivers can operate in two modes: polling and interrupt.
 * The UART HAL driver, for example, can operate in polling and interrupt modes during data communication. The polling mode is suitable for read and write operations of a small amount of data in low frequency. The interrupt mode is suitable for read and write operations of small amount of data in high frequency. In UART DMA mode, for example, an interrupt is triggered when the DMA is complete.
 * - \b Polling \b mode \b architecture \n
 *   Most of the driver modules support the polling mode, which is the basic feature in HAL.\n
 *   For example, call the #hal_gpt_delay_ms() API to apply a millisecond time delay in the GPT. The GPT HAL driver will poll the GPT hardware if the time delay is reached.\n
 *   The polling mode driver architecture is shown below:
 *   @image html hal_overview_driver_polling_architecture.png
 *
 * - \b Interrupt \b mode \b architecture \n
 *   To improve the portability, the HAL driver hides the OS dependence by preventing the upper layer to call the OS level services directly. The HAL drivers uses an interrupt handler to provide the upper layer with a callback mechanism.
 *
 *   To use the interrupt handler of a driver module, a callback must be registered with the interrupt handler. When the interrupt occurs, the callback is invoked in Cortex-M4 handler mode.
 *   Call the #hal_gpt_sw_start_timer_ms() API to start a timer. When the timer expires, the GPT hardware issues an interrupt. The GPT HAL driver then invokes the user callback in the interrupt handler to notify that the timer has expired.
 *   The interrupt mode driver architecture is shown in the following image:
 *   @image html hal_overview_interrupt_mode_architecture.png
 *
 *   All HAL APIs are thread-safe and available for ISR. Developers can call HAL APIs in any FreeRTOS task or in an ISR.\n
 *   However, some hardware has limited resources, and the corresponding APIs return an "ERROR_BUSY" status when there is a resource conflict due to the re-entrance. Developers should always check the return values from HAL APIs.\n
 * @section HAL_Overview_4_Chapter    The Architecture Of DSP Platform
 *   "Processors have traditionally been extremely difficult to design and modify. Therefore, most systems contain rigid processors that were designed and verified once for general-purpose use and then embedded into multiple applications over time. Because these processors are general-purpose designs, their suitability to any particular application is less than ideal. Although it would be preferable to have a processor specifically designed to execute a particular application¡¯s code better (for example, to run faster, or consume less power, or cost less), this is rarely possible because of the difficulty; the time, cost, and risk of modifying an existing processor or developing a new processor is very high."-Reference from "Xtensa Instruction Set Architesture (ISA).pdf"\n
 *   So we need to add some DSP processors to our platform. For example, On the platform of AB155x, we used the DSP of HiFi Mini designed by Xtensa.\n
 *   On AB155x platform there are two DSP processors and share all of the external hardware resources including the bus system and peripherals. The architecture is shown below.\n
 *   @image html hal_overview_dsp_platform_architecture.png
 * 
 * @section HAL_Overview_5_Chapter    The convention of cross core memory access
 *  Every core have its own sleep and DCM mechanism. \n
 *  Because DSP0 I/DRAM and DSP1 I/DRAM locate in the core, if DSP0 or DSP1 enter sleep or enter DCM mode, other cores or DMA will can not access DSP0 and DSP1.\n
 *  So if user want to do DSP I/DRAM memory access cross cores, need to do sleep lock for the target core.
 *  @image html hal_overview_cross_core_memory_access.png
 *  Note:\n 
 *       1. For customer and upper layer users, CM4 should not access DSP0 and DSP1 I/DRAM.
 *       2. When user call hal_sleep_manager_lock_sleep() to do sleep lock cross cores, must guarantee the target core had been boot up. \n
 *         Because the fucntion means the source core will send event via CCNI to the target core and wait for the target core lock sleep by itself done.\n
 *  The pseudocode of CPU to do memory access cross cores:
 * @code
 *      //DSP0 want to access DSP1 DRAM:
 *      hal_sleep_manager_lock_sleep(SLEEP_LOCK_DSP1_CROSS_MEMORY_ACCESS);
 *      // please add your code of DSP0 access DSP1 DRAM to here!!!
 *      hal_sleep_manager_unlock_sleep(SLEEP_LOCK_DSP1_CROSS_MEMORY_ACCESS);
 * @endcode
 *  The pseudocode of DMA to do memory access cross cores:
 * @code
 *  //DSP0 start DMA to access DSP1 DRAM:
 *  // User should lock DSP1 sleep before start DMA
 *  // source_address or destination_address is DSP1 DRAM.
 *       hal_sw_gdma_status_t status;
 *       temp_dma_cfg.source_address = source_address;
 *       temp_dma_cfg.destination_address = destination_address;
 *       temp_dma_cfg.length = dma_length;
 *       temp_dma_cfg.func = user_dma_transfer_done_callback;
 *       temp_dma_cfg.argument = NULL;
 *       temp_dma_cfg.h_size = HAL_SW_DMA_WORD;
 *       temp_dma_cfg.dma_type = HAL_SW_DMA_NORMAL_MODE;
 *       hal_sleep_manager_lock_sleep(SLEEP_LOCK_DSP1_CROSS_MEMORY_ACCESS);
 *       status = hal_sw_gdma_start(&temp_dma_cfg);
 *       if (status != HAL_SW_DMA_STATUS_OK) {
 *           // Error handling.
 *       }
 * 
 *  // this function is the DMA callback, user should do DSP1 sleep unlock after DMA copy done.
 *      void user_dma_transfer_done_callback()
 *      {
 *          // now DMA copy done!!!
 *          hal_sleep_manager_unlock_sleep(SLEEP_LOCK_DSP1_CROSS_MEMORY_ACCESS);
 *      }
 * @endcode
 * @}

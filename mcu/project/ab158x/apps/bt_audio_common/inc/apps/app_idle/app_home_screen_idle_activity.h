* @param[in]  event_id, the current event ID to be handled.
* @param[in]  extra_data, extra data pointer of the current event, NULL means there is no extra data.
* @param[in]  data_len, the length of the extra data. 0 means extra_data is NULL.
* @return     If return true, the current event cannot be handle by the next activity.

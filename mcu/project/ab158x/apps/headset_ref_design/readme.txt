@par Run the application
  - How to build the headset_ref_design application
  - GCC version
    - make command "./build.sh <board> headset_ref_design -f=feature_<board>.mk"
      under the SDK/mcu root folder.
    - make command "./build.sh <board> headset_ref_design -fm=feature_<board>.mk -fd0=feature_<board>.mk" 
      under the SDK root folder.
  - How to download the headset_ref_design application
    - Install and use Flash Tool ("sdk_root/tools/PC_tool_Win.zip") to download the
      application binary headset_ref_design.bin.
  - How to run each feature
    - Power on the board and use the smartphone to search for and connect to the BT device.
      Then use BT device as a headset.

@par Troubleshooting

 *  The audio parameter is named as "NVDM" and "NvKey" on the CM4 and DSP0 platform, respectively.
 *  The content of NVDM's id and data is the same as the NvKey's ones.
 *
 *  The Nvdm Allocation Table(NAT) stores the DSP feature related nvdm data described as follows.
 *    a. The NAT uses memory space size(=NAT_MEM_Size) on the SYSRAM.
 *    b. Each nvdm information will store on the NAT header, and the number of NVDM item is up to NAT_NVDM_ITEM_MAX.
 *    c. According to the DSP feature, the nvdm related information(nvdm id, length, chksum and offset) is written header in sequence.
 *       The nvdm_id1 is the ID of first nvdm item. The nvdm's data is allocated to the offset address stored on offset1 variable.
 *       The physical SYSRAM address of nvdm iterm1 data is base_addr + offset1.
 *       The length1 and chksum1 of nvdm iterm1 header will record the length and check-sum of the fisrt nvdm data, respectively.

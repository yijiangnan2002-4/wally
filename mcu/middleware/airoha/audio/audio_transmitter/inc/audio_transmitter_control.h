 * The audio_transmitter is used to control some specific applications.
 *
 * @section audio_transmitter_api_usage How to use this module
 *
 * - An example on how to use the audio_transmitter APIs.\n
 *  - 1.  Call #audio_transmitter_init() to init audio_transmitter and get audio_transmitter id.
 *  - 2.  Call #audio_transmitter_start() to start this senario.
 *        When event AUDIO_TRANSMITTER_EVENT_START_SUCCESS is received, the scenario has successfully started.
 *  - 3.  If this scenario can set config param, call #audio_transmitter_set_runtime_config() to set config.
 *  - 4.  If this scenario can get config param, call #audio_transmitter_get_runtime_config() to get config.
 *  - 5.  If this scenario needs receive data from dsp side, \n
 *        call #audio_transmitter_get_read_information() to get data address and data length,
 *        call #audio_transmitter_read_done() to flush data.
 *  - 6.  If this scenario needs send data to dsp side, \n
 *        call #audio_transmitter_get_write_information() to get the address where the data is placed and maximum length that can be placed.
 *        call #audio_transmitter_write_done() to send data.
 *  - 7.  Call #audio_transmitter_stop() to stop this senario.
 *  - 8.  Call #audio_transmitter_deinit() to deinit this senario.
 *    - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *
 *       static void test_audio_transmitter_event_callback(audio_transmitter_event_t event,void *data, void *user_data)
 *       {

NVDM library usage guide

Brief:          This module is the source code of the non-volatile data management implementation.
Usage:          You do not directly call this library. You call the NVDM interface and the NVMD driver wraps the library to be compatible for the the specific platform.
                The Airoha service is transparent and you can always see the processes that are occurring, regardless of the platform.

 * 4K size flash starting from start_address. erase_status[0].bit6 represents the second 4K size flash. erase_status[1].bit7 represents the 9th
 * 4K size flash and so on. If the 4K size flash is erased, the bit value is 1. Otherwise, it is 0. This function is designed only for the bootloader.
 * Be aware that if the flash reading speed is low and the length is long, it might take time before this function returns.
 * If erase_status is NULL and erase_status_size is not NULL, erase_status_size works as a output parameter and returns the minimux size of
 * erase_status needed. If erase_status is not NULL, erase_status_size works as a input parameter and represents the size of erase_status
 * in bytes.
 * @param[out] erase_status The erased status result.
 * @param[in/out] erase_status_size The size of erase_status in bytes.
 * @param[in] start_address The start address of the specific part of the flash.
 * @param[in] length The length of the specific part of the flash.
 * @param[in] is_int It indicates if the flash is the internal flash or not.

 * |----------------------|----------------------------------|
 * |\b airokey            | a flexible framework to realize many kinds of key events. |
 *
 *
 * @section airokey_Features_Chapter Supported features
 *
 * - **Support various modules**
 *   - Airokey supports several kinds of key types, such as gsensor, eintkey, captouch, powerkey, and so on.
 * - **Easy to expand**
 *   - It is easy to expand other types of key modules in airokey, as long as this module supports press & release events.
 *   - It is easy to expand the event type, such as expanding the click level to a quad-click or penta-click, or changing a long press event to a different time level.
 *
 * @section airokey_APIs_Usage_Chapter How to use the airokey APIs?
 *
 * - To use the airokey services follow the steps, as shown below. \n
 *  - Step 1. Copy middleware/airoha/key/template_config/airo_key_config.h to user's project path.
 *  - Step 2. Include \$(SOURCE_DIR)/middleware/airoha/key/module.mk in user's Makefile.
 *      - If user wants to use eintkey, include \$(SOURCE_DIR)/driver/board/\$(BOARD_CONFIG)/eint_key/module.mk in user's Makefile.
 *      - If user wants to use gsensor, include \$(SOURCE_DIR)/driver/board/component/gsensor_key/module.mk in user's Makefile.
 *      - If user wants to use captouch, the macro HAL_CAPTOUCH_MODULE_ENABLED must be defined in hal_feature_config.h.
 *      - If user wants to use powerkey, the macro HAL_PMU_MODULE_ENABLED must be defined in hal_feature_config.h, because powerkey
 *        relies on the PMU module. The three-line comments below must be removed from airo_key_config.h.
 *    @code
 *        //#ifdef HAL_PMU_MODULE_ENABLED
 *        //#define AIRO_KEY_FEATRURE_POWERKEY
 *        //#endif
 *    @endcode
 *  - Step 3. Call airo_key_event_init() to initialize the airokey module.
 *  - Step 4. Implement a callback function in airo_key_callback_t type to process all kinds of key events.
 *  - Step 5. Call airo_key_register_callback() to register the callback function.
 *  - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       void airo_key_eint_key_callback(airo_key_event_t event, uint8_t key_data, void *user_data)
 *       {
 *          // The incoming value of key_data aligns with the value in the file airo_key_config.h, which is defined by user.
 *          switch(key_data) {
 *          case EINT_KEY_0:
 *              // Perform the action according to the specific event type.
 *              break;
 *
 *          case DEVICE_POWER_KEY:
 *              // Perform the action according to the specific event type.
 *              break;
 *
 *          case default:
 *              break;
 *          }
 *       }
 *       ret = airo_key_event_init();
 *       if (ret == false) {
 *          // Perform the error-handling operation.
 *       }
 *       ret = airo_key_register_callback(airo_key_eint_key_callback, NULL);
 *       if (ret == false) {
 *          // Perform the error-handling operation.
 *       }
 *    @endcode
 *
 * @section airokey_Customization_Chapter How to customize keys?
 *  - To customize keys, the user must consider the following three things:
 *    - How to specify the key numbers that the user wants to use?
 *    - How to identify a key?
 *       - key_data is used to identify a key, when user receives an event from the callback function, they can
 *         refer to key_data to know which key the event belongs to.
 *       - The macro AIRO_KEY_MAPPING, which is defined in airo_key_config.h, contains parameters of the keys of
 *         all key modules which are defined by user, except for the gsensor module. AIRO_GSENSOR_KEY_MAPPING contains
 *         the gsensor settings. Each element of AIRO_KEY_MAPPING or AIRO_GSENSOR_KEY_MAPPING is airo_key_event_config_t type,
 *         its first value is key_data and can be customized by user.
 *    - How to enable the hardware?
 *
 *  - Details about customizing keys. \n
 *
 *   - eintkey \n
 *     - Key numbers \n
 *        The hardware supported key numbers are determined by the macro BSP_EINT_KEY_NUMBER which is defined in the file
 *        driver/board/\<board type\>/eint_key/inc/eint_key_custom.h. The maximum value of BSP_EINT_KEY_NUMBER
 *        is currently four. The user does not have to change the value if the number of eintkey is less than four, it shows
 *        the ability of hardware to support the numbers of keys, in other words, although there are four keys defined in
 *        eint_key_custom.h. The user can configure any number of keys (up to four) in airo_key_config.h.
 *     - key_data \n
 *        There are two places to specify the key_data: one is driver/board/\<board type\>/eint_key/inc/eint_key_custom.h,
 *        we named it as A; the other place is middleware/airoha/key/template_config/airo_key_config.h, we named it as B.
 *        key_data in position A shows the ability of hardware to support the numbers of keys. key_data in position B shows
 *        the user's configuration. Its value must align with the key_data in position A.
 *     - Hardware function configuration \n
 *        User must use the EPT tool to configure the GPIO functions. This tool generates several files, including ept_gpio_var.c
 *        and ept_eint_var.c. The user must copy these files to the project folder. driver/board/\<board type\>/eint_key/src/eint_key_custom.c
 *        must have the variables from these files, including BSP_EINTKEYx_PIN, BSP_EINTKEYx_PIN_M_EINT and BSP_EINTKEYx_EINT (x=0/1/2/3),
 *        to configure GPIOs.
 *
 *   - gsensor \n
 *     - Key numbers \n
 *        Only one key is supported. Two types of sensor are supported, including LIS2DS12 and LIS2DW12. User can switch the
 *        sensor by defining a macro, GSENSOR_LIS2DW12_EANBLE or GSENSOR_LIS2DS12_EANBLE in the file driver/board/component/gsensor_key/module.mk.
 *     - key_data \n
 *        It is specified by a macro AIRO_CONFIG_GSENSOR_KEY, which is defined in middleware/airoha/key/template_config/airo_key_config.h.
 *     - Hardware function configuration \n
 *        No additional hardware function configuration is required.
 *
 *   - captouch \n
 *     - Key numbers \n
 *        The number of hardware supported keys is eight. The user must use the EPT tool to configure which key is used, This tool generates
 *        several files, including ept_keypad_drv.h, each bit of macro DRV_KBD_CAPTOUCH_SEL in ept_keypad_drv.h represents a key.
 *     - key_data \n
 *        There are two places to specify the key_data: one is the macro KEYPAD_MAPPING in file ept_keypad_drv.h, which is generated
 *        by the EPT tool, we named it as A. The other place is middleware/airoha/key/template_config/airo_key_config.h, we named it
 *        as B. key_data in position A shows the ability of hardware to support the numbers of keys. key_data in position B shows
 *        the user's configuration. Its value must align with the key_data in position A.
 *     - Hardware function configuration \n
 *        No additional hardware function configuration is required. The user must make sure that the macro DRV_KBD_CAPTOUCH_SEL can
 *        not be 0, or none of the captouch keys will operate as expected.
 *
 *   - powerkey
 *     - Key numbers \n
 *        Only one key is supported.
 *     - key_data \n
 *        There are two places to specify the key_data: one is a macro POWERKEY_POSITION in file ept_keypad_drv.h, which is generated
 *        by the EPT tool, we named it as A. The other place is middleware/airoha/key/template_config/airo_key_config.h, we named it
 *        as B. key_data in position A shows the ability of hardware to support the numbers of keys. key_data in position B shows
 *        the user's configuration. Its value must align with the key_data in position A.
 *     - Hardware function configuration \n
 *        No additional hardware function configuration is required. The powerkey module is used to expand the function of the power key
 *        itself; it sets the power key as a normal key.

 * @brief  The type of airokey callback function.
 *
 * @param[in] event means that whatever happened to a key. It must be processed by the user.
 * @param[in] key_data is used to identify a specific key.
 *            please refer to the comments in airo_key_event_config_t for more details.
 * @param[in] user_data is passed in by airo_key_register_callback function when this type
 *            of callback function is registered.
 * @return    None
 * @note      The user should not do anything that consumes too much time in the callback function.
 *            Because this callback function is in the ISR level, we suggest that the user distributes
 *            the events to tasks for subsequent processing in the application with an OS.

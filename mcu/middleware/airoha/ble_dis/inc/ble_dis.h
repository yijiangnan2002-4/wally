 *
 * @section ble_dis_api_usage How to use this module
 * - Step 1. Add DIS service to the application's GATT service database. And then return the bt_gatts_service_t pointer to GATTS stack by implementing the user-defined callback @ref bt_get_gatt_server().
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *               // The GATTS collects all services.
 *               const bt_gatts_service_t * ble_gatt_server[] = {
 *                   &ble_gap_service,  // handle range: 0x0001 to 0x0009.
 *                   &ble_gatt_service, // handle range: 0x0011 to 0x0015.
 *                   &ble_dis_service,  // handle range: 0x0060 to 0x0072.
 *                   NULL
 *                };
 *                const bt_gatts_service_t** bt_get_gatt_server()
 *                {
 *                    return ble_gatt_server;
 *                }

 *     @endcode
 * - Step 2. Implement the user-defined callback @ref ble_dis_alert_level_write_callback() to listen to the write event of the Alert Level Characteristic.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *               #define MANUFACTURER_NAME               "MEDIATEK"
 *
 *              bt_status_t ble_dis_get_characteristic_value_callback(ble_dis_charc_type_t charc, void *value)
 *              {
 *                 bt_status_t status = BT_STATUS_FAIL;
 *               switch (charc) {
 *                   case BLE_DIS_CHARC_MANUFACTURER_NAME: {
 *                      if (value) {
 *                       ble_dis_string_t *buffer = (ble_dis_string_t *)value;
 *                       buffer->length = (uint16_t)strlen(MANUFACTURER_NAME);
 *                       buffer->string = (uint8_t *)MANUFACTURER_NAME;
 *                      }
 *                     break;
 *                   }
 *                   default:
 *                     break;
 *                }
 *
 *                return status;
 *            }
 *     @endcode

 * @section spp_air_api_usage How to use this module
 * - Step 1. Call #bt_spp_air_main() to initialize the SPPAIR module. It is better to invoke this function during the system bootup and it should be called one time in a project.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                //call the enter function of SPPAIR on the initialization procedure of the project.
 *                bt_spp_air_main();
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 2. Call #spp_air_init() to register an event handler of your application to listen to the events defined by #spp_air_event_t.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                spp_air_init(serial_port_spp_air_event_callback);
 *                static void serial_port_spp_air_event_callback(spp_air_event_t event_id, void *param) {
 *                    case SPP_AIR_CONNECT_IND: {
 *                        // Save the connection info.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                    case SPP_AIR_DISCONNECT_IND: {
 *                        // Delete the connection info.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                    case SPP_AIR_RECIEVED_DATA_IND: {
 *                        // Save the data.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                    case SPP_AIR_READY_TO_SEND_IND: {
 *                        // Resend the TX data when OOM.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 3. Call #spp_air_write_data() and #spp_air_read_data() to send data and read data.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                real_send_size = spp_air_write_data(conn_handle, write_data, write_data_length);
 *                real_read_size = spp_air_read_data(conn_handle, read_data, read_data_length);
 *     @endcode

 * @section ble_air_api_usage How to use this module
 * - Step 1. Call #ble_air_main() to initialize the BLEAIR module. It is better to invoke this function during the system bootup and it should be called only one time in a project.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                //call the enter function of BLEAIR on the initialization procedure of the project.
 *                ble_air_main();
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 2. Call #ble_air_init() to register an event handler of your application to listen to the events defined by #ble_air_event_t.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                ble_air_init(serial_port_ble_air_event_callback);
 *                static void serial_port_ble_air_event_callback(ble_air_event_t event_id, void *param) {
 *                    case BLE_AIR_EVENT_CONNECT_IND: {
 *                        // Save the connection info.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                    case BLE_AIR_EVENT_DISCONNECT_IND: {
 *                        // Delete the connection info.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                    case BLE_AIR_EVENT_READY_TO_READ_IND: {
 *                        // Read the data.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                    case BLE_AIR_EVENT_READY_TO_WRITE_IND: {
 *                        // Send the data.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 3. Call #ble_air_write_data() and #ble_air_read_data() to send data and read data.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                real_send_size = ble_air_write_data(conn_handle, write_data, write_data_length);
 *                real_read_size = ble_air_read_data(conn_handle, read_data, read_data_length);
 *     @endcode

 * @section airupdate_api_usage How to use this module
 * - Step 1. Call @ref airupdate_main() to initialize the AIRUPDATE module. It is better to invoke this function during the system bootup and it should be called only one time in a project.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                //call the enter function of AIRUPDATE on the initialization procedure of the project.
 *                #ifdef MTK_AIRUPDATE_ENABLE
 *                    airupdate_main();
 *                #endif
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 2. Call @ref airupdate_init() to register an event handler of your application to listen to the events defined by #airupdate_event_t.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                static void serial_port_airupdate_event_callback(airupdate_event_t event_id, void *param);
 *                airupdate_init(serial_port_airupdate_event_callback);
 *                static void serial_port_airupdate_event_callback(airupdate_event_t event_id, void *param) {
 *                    case AIRUPDATE_CONNECT_IND: {
 *                        // Save the connection info.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                    case AIRUPDATE_DISCONNECT_IND: {
 *                        // Delete the connection info.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                    case AIRUPDATE_RECIEVED_DATA_IND: {
 *                        // Save the data.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                    case AIRUPDATE_READY_TO_SEND_IND: {
 *                        // resend the tx data when OOM.
 *                        break;
 *                    }
 *                }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 3. Call @ref airupdate_write_data() and @ref airupdate_read_data() to send data and read data.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                uint32_t real_send_size, real_read_size;
 *                real_send_size = airupdate_write_data(conn_handle, write_data, write_data_length);
 *                real_read_size = airupdate_read_data(conn_handle, read_data, read_data_length);
 *     @endcode

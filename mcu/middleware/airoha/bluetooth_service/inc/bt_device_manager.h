 * @{
 * This section provides APIs to get Bluetooth device information and handle the bonding procedures.
 *
 * @section device_manager_api_usage How to use this module
 * - Step 1. Initialize the device manager at boot up.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                bt_device_manager_init();
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 2. Use device manager APIs to access the paired device list.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *               uint32_t read_number = 5;
 *               uint32_t i;
 *               bt_device_manager_paired_infomation_t paired_devices[5];
 *               bt_device_manager_get_paired_list(paired_devices, &read_number);
 *               for(i = 0; i < read_number; i++)
 *               {
 *                   printf("paired index: %d, device name: %s", i, paired_devices->name);
 *               }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 3. Delete a paired device.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *               bt_bd_addr_t address = {0x00, 0x33, 0x63, 0x56, 0xE0, 0x4C};
 *               if (bt_device_manager_is_paired((bt_bd_addr_ptr_t)address)) {
 *                   bt_device_manager_delete_paired_device((bt_bd_addr_ptr_t) address);
 *               }
 *     @endcode

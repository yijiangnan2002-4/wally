 * This section provides APIs for different APP module users to discover GATT Services on remote server.

 * |Terms                         |Details                                                                  |

 * |\b GATTC                      | GATT Client is the device that initiates commands and requests to the server. |
 *
 * @section bt_gattc_discovery_api_usage How to use this module
 * - Step 1. Mandatory, initialize the GATTC discovery service.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *              bt_gattc_discovery_init();
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 2. Implement discovery event callback function to handle the GATTC discovery events.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *             static void demo_discovery_callback(bt_gattc_discovery_event_t *event)
 *             {
 *                 if (event == NULL) {
 *                     APPS_LOG_MSGID_E("discovery_callback, NULL event", 0);
 *                     return;
 *                 }
 *
 *                 if (event->event_type == BT_GATTC_DISCOVERY_EVENT_FAIL) {
 *                     // discovery failed
 *                     APPS_LOG_MSGID_I("discovery_callback, error_code:0x%04x, conn_handle=0x%04x", 2, event->params.error_code, event->conn_handle);
 *                     return;
 *                 } else if (event->event_type == BT_GATTC_DISCOVERY_EVENT_COMPLETE) {
 *                     // discovery completed
 *                     APPS_LOG_MSGID_I("discovery_callback, completed! uuid=0x%04x", 1, event->params.discovered_db->service_uuid.uuid.uuid16);
 *                     APPS_LOG_MSGID_I("discovery_callback, found charateristics num: %d", 1, event->params.discovered_db->char_count_found);
 *                 }
 *
 *                 bt_gattc_discovery_continue(event->conn_handle);
 *             }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 3. The upper users call this function @ref bt_gattc_discovery_register_service to register the services that they want to discover.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *              #define MAX_CHARC_NUM 2
 *              #define MAX_CHARC0_DESCR_NUM 2
 *              #define MAX_CHARC1_DESCR_NUM 3
 *
 *              bt_gattc_discovery_characteristic_t charc[MAX_CHARC_NUM];
 *              bt_gattc_discovery_descriptor_t charc0_descr[MAX_CHARC0_DESCR_NUM];
 *              bt_gattc_discovery_descriptor_t charc1_descr[MAX_CHARC1_DESCR_NUM];
 *              bt_gattc_discovery_service_t service_buffer;
 *              bt_gattc_discovery_user_data_t user_data;
 *
 *              charc[0].descriptor_count = MAX_CHARC0_DESCR_NUM;
 *              charc[0].descriptor = charc0_descr;
 *
 *              charc[1].descriptor_count = MAX_CHARC1_DESCR_NUM;
 *              charc[1].descriptor = charc1_descr;
 *
 *              service_buffer.characteristic_count = MAX_CHARC_NUM;
 *              service_buffer.charateristics = charc;
 *
 *              user_data.uuid.type = BLE_UUID_TYPE_16BIT;
 *              user_data.uuid.uuid.uuid16 = 0xAABB;
 *              user_data.need_cache = FALSE;
 *              user_data.srv_info = &service_buffer;
 *              user_data.handler = demo_discovery_callback;
 *
 *              bt_gattc_discovery_register_service(BT_GATTC_DISCOVERY_USER_LE_AUDIO, &user_data);
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 3. Use function bt_gattc_discovery_start to trigger start discovery gatt services by uuid.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *               bt_gattc_discovery_start(BT_GATTC_DISCOVERY_USER_LE_AUDIO, conn_handle, TRUE);
 *     @endcode

 *
 * @section HAL_AESOTF_ESC_Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use this driver
 *
 * - Use the AESOTF_ESC to encrypt/decrypt. \n
 *   To use the AESOTF_ESC driver, the caller should allocate a buffer in physical memory region, e.g. TCM, SYSRAM and PSRAM.
 *  - Step 1. Call #hal_aesotf_esc_enable() to encrypt/decrypt.
 *  - sample code:
 *    @code
 *       ATTR_RWDATA_IN_NONCACHED_SYSRAM_4BYTE_ALIGN uint8_t hardware_id[16] = {
 *           0x4d, 0x54, 0x4b, 0x30, 0x30, 0x30, 0x30, 0x30,
 *           0x32, 0x30, 0x31, 0x34, 0x30, 0x38, 0x31, 0x35
 *       };
 *
 *       ATTR_RWDATA_IN_NONCACHED_SYSRAM_4BYTE_ALIGN uint8_t nonce[HAL_AESOTF_ESC_NONCE_LENGTH] = {
 *           0x61, 0x33, 0x46, 0x68, 0x55, 0x38, 0x31, 0x43,
 *           0x77, 0x68, 0x36, 0x33, 0x50, 0x76, 0x33, 0x46
 *       };
 *
 *       ATTR_RWDATA_IN_NONCACHED_SYSRAM_4BYTE_ALIGN uint8_t decrypted_buffer[16] = {0};
 *
 *       ATTR_RWDATA_IN_NONCACHED_SYSRAM_4BYTE_ALIGN hal_aesotf_esc_buffer_t key = {
 *           .buffer = hardware_id,
 *           .length = sizeof(hardware_id)
 *       };
 *
 *       hal_aesotf_esc_init();
 *
 *       hal_aesotf_esc_set_region(BL_BASE, BL_LENGTH, 0);
 *
 *       hal_aesotf_esc_status_t hal_aesotf_esc_enable(&key, &nonce, HAL_AESOTF_ESC_KEY_SOURCE_SWKEY);
 *
 *       memcpy(decrypted_buffer, BL_BASE, 16);

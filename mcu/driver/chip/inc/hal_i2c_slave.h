 * @section HAL_I2C_SLAVE_Features_Chapter Supported features
 * - \b Supported \b transaction \b modes
 *  - \b Polling \b mode \b transaction
 *    In polling mode, the functions with the suffix "_polling" will not return any value until the transaction is complete.
 *    After the function returns, the return value should be checked and the error status should be handled.
 *
 *  - \b DMA \b mode \b transaction
 *    In DMA mode, the functions with the suffix "_dma" return a value once the I2C slave and DMA hardware registers are assigned.
 *    These functions do not wait for the transaction to finish. After the transaction finishes, an interrupt is triggered and the user callback in the I2C slave ISR
 *    routine is called. After the function returns, the return value should be checked and the error status should be handled.
 *
 * @section HAL_I2C_SLAVE_Architecture_Chapter Software architecture of the I2C Slave
 * - \b Polling \b mode \b architecture. \n
 *   Polling mode architecture is similar to the polling mode architecture in HAL overview. See @ref HAL_Overview_3_Chapter for polling mode architecture.
 * - \b DMA \b mode \b architecture. \n
 *   DMA mode architecture is similar to the interrupt mode architecture in HAL overview. See @ref HAL_Overview_3_Chapter for interrupt mode architecture.
 *
 *
 * @section HAL_I2C_Slave_Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use this driver
 * - \b Using \b I2C \b Slave \b in \b polling \b mode.  \n
 *  To use I2C slave driver in a polling mode, configure GPIO pins to pinmux to SCL and SDA, then call
 *  #hal_pinmux_set_function() to select the pinmux function. After setting the pinmux, call #hal_gpio_set_schmitt() to enable schmitt on
 *  i2c slave pins. Once the data is successfully transmitted, call #hal_i2c_slave_deinit() to release the I2C slave resource for other users.\n
 *  Steps are shown below:
 *  - Step1: Call #hal_gpio_init() to initialize the pin. For mode details about hal_gpio_init please refer to GPIO module in HAL.
 *  - Step2: Call #hal_pinmux_set_function() to set the GPIO pinmux or use the EPT tool to apply the pinmux settings.
 *  - Step3: Call #hal_gpio_set_schmitt() to enable schmitt.
 *  - Step4: Call #hal_i2c_slave_init() to initialize the I2C slave.
 *  - Step5: Call #hal_i2c_slave_send_polling() to send data in a polling mode.
 *  - Step6: Call #hal_i2c_slave_receive_polling() to receive data in a polling mode.
 *  - Step7: Call #hal_i2c_slave_deinit() to de-allocate the I2C slave if it is no longer in use.
 *  - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       int32_t success_size = 0;

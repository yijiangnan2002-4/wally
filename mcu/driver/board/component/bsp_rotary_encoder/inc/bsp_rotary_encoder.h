 * @section Rotary_Encoder_High_Level_Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use the rotary encoder
 *  The steps are shown below:
 *   - Step 1: Call #bsp_rotary_encoder_init() to initialize the rotary encoder module.
 *   - Step 2: Call #bsp_rotary_encoder_enable() to enable the external interrupt of all rotary encoder.
 *
 *   - Sample code:
 *  @code
 * static void bsp_rotary_encoder_callback(bsp_rotary_encoder_port_t port, bsp_rotary_encoder_event_t event, uint32_t position, void *user_data)
 *  {
 *      uint8_t *event_type[2] = {"CW","CCW"};
 *
 *      printf("[%s]port=%d key event=%s user_data=%d", __func__, port, event_type[event], position);
 *  }
 *
 *   bsp_rotary_encoder_status_t status;
 *   bsp_rotary_encoder_config_t config;
 *   uint32_t user_data;
 *
 *   config.callback = bsp_rotary_encoder_callback;
 *   config.eint_debounce_time_ms = 10;
 *   config.user_data = (void*)&user_data;
 *   config.event_threshold = 4;
 *   config.event_timeout_ms = 100;
 *
 *   status = bsp_rotary_encoder_init(BSP_ROTARY_ENCODER_0, &config);
 *   if (status != BSP_ROTARY_ENCODER_STATUS_OK) {
 *       printf("rotary init fail = %d\r\n", status);
 *   }

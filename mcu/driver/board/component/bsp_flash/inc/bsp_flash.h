 * |\b SFC           | The serial flash controller (SFC) supports convenient high-speed serial NOR flash access and flexible macro command sequence read/write. |
 * |\b SIP           | System in package. It is a number of integrated circuits enclosed in a single chip carrier package. For more information, please check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_in_package"> System in package in Wikipedia</a>.|
 * |\b SPI           | Serial Peripheral Interface. The Serial Peripheral Interface bus is a synchronous serial communication interface specification used for short distance communication. For more information, please check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_peripheral_interface"> Serial Peripheral Interface Bus in Wikipedia</a>.|
 * |\b ESC           | The External SRAM Controller provides the platform capability to extend its memory space. |
 *
 * @section BSP_FLASH_Features_Chapter Supported features
 * The general purpose of FLASH is to save data. The features supported by this module are listed below:
 * - \b FLASH \b erase \n
 * It must be erased before data can be saved into the FLASH storage; Function #bsp_flash_erase() implements this operation.
 * - \b FLASH \b write \n
 * Function #bsp_flash_write() is called to save data into the FLASH storage after it is erased.
 * - \b FLASH \b read \n
 * Function #bsp_flash_read() is called to read data from the FLASH storage.
 * - \b High-level \b abstraction \n
 * Users can use BSP APIs to operate all types of Flash supported by the SDK. BSP flash can operate different types of Flash through different addresses specified by users.

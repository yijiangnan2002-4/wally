 *
 * @section BSP_EXTERNAL_FLASH_Features_Chapter Supported features
 * The general purpose of External FLASH is to save data. The features supported by this module are listed below:
 * - \b FLASH \b erase \n
 * It must be erased before data can be saved into the FLASH storage; Function #bsp_external_flash_erase() implements this operation.
 * - \b FLASH \b write \n
 * Function #bsp_external_flash_write() is called to save data into the External FLASH storage after it is erased.
 * - \b FLASH \b read \n
 * Function #bsp_external_flash_read() is called to read data from the external FLASH storage.
 *
 * @section BSP_FLASH_Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use the memory of external FLASH
 * - It defines a virtual address for the SPI external flash as SPI_SERIAL_FLASH_ADDRESS.
 *     It means the flash operation address is from SPI_SERIAL_FLASH_ADDRESS to SPI_SERIAL_FLASH_ADDRESS + FLASH size.
 * - The user must pre-define the memory before using it.
 * * - \b FLASH \b read \b and \b Write
 *   - Step 1: Call #hal_gpio_init() to inite the pins, if EPT tool hasn't been used to configure the related pinmux.
 *   - Step 2: Call #hal_pinmux_set_function() to set GPIO pinmux, if EPT tool hasn't been used to configure the related pinmux.
 *             For more details about #hal_pinmux_set_function(), please refer to @ref GPIO.
 *   - Step 3: Call #bsp_external_flash_init() to initialize the external FLASH module.
 *   - Step 4: Call #bsp_external_flash_erase() to erase the target block of the external FLASH storage before write.
 *   - Step 5: Call #bsp_external_flash_write() to write data to the external FLASH storage.
 *   - Step 6: Call #bsp_external_flash_read() to read data from the external FLASH storage.
 *   - Step 7: Call #bsp_external_flash_deinit() to de-initialize the driver.
 *   - Sample code:
 *  @code
 *  void external_flash_test(void)
 *  {
 *     #define MAX_DATA (4096)
 *     uint8_t data_to_write[MAX_DATA] = {0};
 *     uint8_t data_read[MAX_DATA] = {0};
 *     // It assumes that the external flash address starts at #SPI_SERIAL_FLASH_ADDRESS,
       // so the start_address must be between 0xB0000000 and 0xB0000000+flash size.
 *     uint32_T start_address = 0xB0010000;
 *     // Initialize the SPI master and external flash
 *     if (EXTERNAL_FLASH_STATUS_OK != bsp_flash_init()) {
 *         //Please do error handling.
 *     }
 *     //Erase 4k form start adress
 *     if (EXTERNAL_FLASH_STATUS_OK != bsp_external_flash_erase(start_address, FLASH_BLOCK_4K)) {
 *         //Please do error handling.
 *     }
 *     //Write data to start address
 *     if (EXTERNAL_FLASH_STATUS_OK != bsp_external_flash_write(start_address, data_to_write, sizeof(data_to_write))) {
 *         //Please do error handling.
 *     }
 *     //Read data from start address.
 *     if (EXTERNAL_FLASH_STATUS_OK != bsp_external_flash_read(start_address, data_read, sizeof(data_read))) {
 *         //Please do error handling.
 *     }
 *     // De-initialize the SPI master and external flash if these are not used any more.
 *     if (EXTERNAL_FLASH_STATUS_OK != bsp_external_flash_deinit()) {
 *         //Please do error handling.
